## Power Plant Emission Analysis
🔗 Interactive Dashboard: View on Power BI

## Overview
This project delivers an in-depth analysis of emissions from 20 selected thermal power plants in India, focusing on major pollutants such as Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂), Nitrogen Oxides (NOₓ), and Particulate Matter (PM).
The goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and variations in emission rates — providing actionable insights into their environmental and public health impacts.

## Motivation
India’s growing energy demand has intensified reliance on thermal power generation, raising concerns about its environmental footprint.
By analyzing emission trends, this project aims to:
Highlight the scale of the problem.
Identify high-emission plants.
Support informed decision-making for sustainable energy management.

## Objectives
Collect Emission Data – Compile accurate, plant-wise pollutant emission data from verified sources.
Analyze Trends – Study year-over-year emission changes for each plant.
Compare Plants – Assess emission differences and explore possible influencing factors.
Methodology
Data Collection – Sourced from public databases, government reports, and research publications.
Data Analysis – Applied statistical methods to detect patterns and anomalies.
Comparative Analysis – Evaluated emission levels across plants to spot leaders and laggards.
Data Creation (MySQL) – Built the database, wrote SQL queries, and extracted key insights.
Data Visualization (Power BI) – Designed an interactive dashboard to present findings in a clear, engaging format.

## Key Features of the Dashboard
📊 Plant-wise Emission Trends – See how emissions have evolved over time.
📌 Comparative Insights – Identify plants with the highest and lowest emission levels.
🌍 Environmental Impact View – Understand potential effects on air quality and health.
